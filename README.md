# task-3
Tasks Performed:
 
Data Retrieval with Basic SQL Clauses
SQL clauses such as SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY are used to retrieve and organize data. Examples include:

Counting orders per state

Listing top customer cities

Identifying high-priced products

Combining Tables with Joins
Different tables are connected using INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN to access related information.

Using Subqueries
Subqueries are used to perform calculations within a main query. For example, identifying products that have a price higher than the average.

Applying Aggregate Functions
Functions like SUM, AVG, and COUNT are used to calculate:

Total revenue

Average freight value

Total number of reviews

Creating Views for Reusable Analysis
A SQL view is created to store a summary of monthly revenue. This allows for easy future access and reporting.

Query Optimization with Indexes
Indexes are added on frequently searched columns such as customer_id, order_status, and product_id to improve query performance.
